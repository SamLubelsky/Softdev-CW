Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL) is a utility which allows windows users
to have easy access to a linux environment.  This allows you to use bash and
have full access to the linux commands you know and love on a windows machine.
There are other options to do this such as dual booting(running two copies of the same os),using 
a virtual machine, or using linux environments such as cygwin or mingw, 
but I found WSL to be the most convenient and supported.

-once you've done all the initial steps of installing wsl in powershell,
I'd recommned just installing Ubuntu For Windows from the windows
store, E

Some things to note for getting started:
-the home directory of WSL is stored in a pretty random location.  You can
find this by typing "explorer.exe ." into the wsl terminal which will bring
up the file explorer in your WSL home directory

-all of your normal computer files(the stuff stored on your C and D drives)
can be found in /mnt/.  You can access these anyway you would like here.

-using Graphical User Interfaces in WSL is kinda weird because WSL cannot 
load any of that stuff because it's just a shell.  This comes up when
working with text editors if you're not using vim or nano.  VSCode has
a WSL extension which pretty much manages all this for you and I am
guessing other popular IDEs do as well.
